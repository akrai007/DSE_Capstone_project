# DSE_Capstone_project - Home Credit Default Risk Prediction
Creating this repository as one stop place for my Data Science project in PGP DSE program'20.
The objective of this project is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. 

This is a standard supervised classification task:

**Supervised:** The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features

**Classification:** The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan)
